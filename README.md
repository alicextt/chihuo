This is a tool to get the reservation info from Din Tai Fung, from Santa Clara location. If you have tried their yelp integration for getting reservation, probably you are as frustrated as I am.

Just clone this repo to your local, run
```
npm install
```
then,
```
node .
```

You will see the reservations and it is also saved as log.js.

They have a weird system that after certain months, maybe 3 or 4 there is no reservation at all. Kill the program when u are after serval months of today or as you see fit.

You can modify in index.js the variables as you see fit.

Have Fun!
